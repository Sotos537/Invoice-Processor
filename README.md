This is an application whuch you can extract the data from invoices with the .jpg extension using OCR and store the data into .csv files

I have done training on greek invoices using yolov5 which i can provide upon request. But feel free to import your own training to better suit the language of the invoices you are trying to process.

For the time being I havent finished with the code to properly store the data into .csv files so you might have some trouble with that. You will also need to download a variety of Python in order to run the code.

This is my very first application so feel free to make any suggestions!
